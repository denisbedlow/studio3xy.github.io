# üëÅÔ∏è Blink Counter

A real-time web application that detects and counts your blinks using computer vision technology.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time blink detection** using MediaPipe Face Mesh
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- **Session statistics** including time tracking and blinks per minute
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for easy interaction
- **Modern UI** with glassmorphism design
- **Privacy-focused** - all processing happens locally in your browser

## üöÄ Live Demo

Visit the live application: [Your GitHub Pages URL]

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application uses Google's MediaPipe Face Mesh model to:
1. Detect facial landmarks in real-time
2. Calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for both eyes
3. Identify blinks when EAR drops below a threshold
4. Filter out false positives with frame-based validation

## üìã Requirements

- Modern web browser with camera support
- Camera permissions
- Stable internet connection (for loading MediaPipe models)

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Start Detection**: Click the "Start Detection" button and allow camera access
2. **Blink Naturally**: The counter will automatically increment with each blink
3. **View Stats**: Monitor your session time and blinks per minute
4. **Reset**: Use the reset button or press 'R' to start over
5. **Stop**: Click "Stop Detection" when finished

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Spacebar**: Manual blink simulation (for testing)
- **R**: Reset counter

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main`
4. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### Option 2: Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blink-counter.git
   cd blink-counter
   ```

2. Serve the files using a local server:
   ```bash

## üéØ Technical Details

### Blink Detection Algorithm
- Uses MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection
- Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for blink detection
- Implements frame-based filtering to reduce false positives
- Adjustable threshold and sensitivity settings

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Chromium: ‚úÖ Full support
- Firefox: ‚úÖ Full support
- Safari: ‚úÖ Full support
- Edge: ‚úÖ Full support

### Privacy & Security
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Camera feed is not recorded or stored
- MediaPipe models are loaded from CDN

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Check if camera is being used by another application
- Try refreshing the page
- Use HTTPS (required for camera access)

### Detection Issues
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep your face centered in the camera view
- Avoid wearing glasses that might interfere with detection
- Try adjusting your distance from the camera

### Performance Issues
- Close other tabs using camera/CPU intensive tasks
- Ensure stable internet connection for model loading
- Try using a different browser

## ü§ù Contributing
